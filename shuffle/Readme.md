Create a function that accepts a string (of a persons first and last name) and returns a string with the first and last name swapped.

Examples
-   nameShuffle("Timothy Smith") ➞ "Smith Timothy"

-   nameShuffle("Mary Nelson") ➞ "Nelson Mary"

-   nameShuffle("John Smith") ➞ "Smith John"

Notes
There will be exactly one space between the first and last name
